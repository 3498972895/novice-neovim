Novice-neovim

This is a personal neovim building by fukuda.

Most keybindings is same as Astronvim

Attention: lsp configuration is concise without using the mason plugin. So lsp is configured locally.
For front-end developer, I use deno built-in lsp-server for javascript/typescript.

html, css and other necessary lsp for front-end development are installed by nodejs globally.
And lua-lsp is installed by luarocks locally.

If you want to download this, never mind.
I am novice, building novice neovim.
